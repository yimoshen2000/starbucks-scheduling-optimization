This project involved the development of a schedule optimization application for three Starbucks locations on the University of Washington campus, utilizing mixed integer programming and linear programming. The application takes in student employee availability forms and returns an optimized schedule, achieving the goals of satisfying minimum and maximum labor needs for all three locations, while maximizing the number of baristas working during peak hours to decrease customer wait times. The project successfully reduced the long manual scheduling process, caused by the erratic nature of student employee availability, from two weeks to just five minutes. Furthermore, the application was designed to be usable and adaptable to future academic quarters, allowing the model to be implemented with any unique set of student employees and ensuring Starbucks at the UW can benefit from the program for a long time to come.
